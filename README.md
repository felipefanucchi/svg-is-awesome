# Svg is Awesome

This is a project just for training and learning skills in Scalable Vector Graphics.

It was born in 1998, but just a few people were taking usage of it, but after adobe came with flash in 2005, your usage has decrease a lot and grew up after 2008 (when apple blocked flash in your devices), and since then, all devices were giving support for this beauty technology.

Svg, can be used in your icons, it's better than using fonts because it don't have a good accessbility for the user if the same don't load in the DOM. 

Svg is just code, different of the font, with this, we can use in many things, like, images or icons with interactions and animations, responsive and adaptative logos, line drawing, use for charts, what is a good pratice, thinking about performance and responsivity, or even use filter in your images, and better, svg will be good in all screens, because it is a vector and it scale conforms the size you need.

It's a good choice, because it's just code, so it's lightweight and performs very well in your project.
